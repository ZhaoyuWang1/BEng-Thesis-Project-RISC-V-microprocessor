## BEng individual project @UCL: low-power, low complexity microprocessor design with RISC-V architecture

A microprocessor is a computer processor with functions such as logic, arithmetic and control, 
which can realize central processing unit (CPU)â€™s work. Its integrated circuit is designed for 
different purposes, driven by the clock signal, and based on the registers. This digital integrated 
circuit accepts binary data at its input, deals with the input using instructions which are stored 
in its memory, and displays results as output also in binary form. To realize these functions, 
both sequential logic and behavioral logic components are applied. Two keywords, architecture 
and microarchitecture are always mentioned with microprocessors. The architecture of a 
microprocessor is defined by the instruction set as well as the operand locations, while the 
microarchitecture is known as the way how the logic building blocks such as registers and ALU 
form the microprocessor. Until now, many microprocessor architectures have established, for 
example MIPS, x86, and ARM.

In this project, I will design a low-complexity and low power microprocessor which could be 
implemented for different applications, for example wireless sensing in Internet of Things. The 
microprocessor will be designed and implemented using System Verilog, simulated with 
ModelSim and demonstrated using an Intel DE0-nano FPGA board.
